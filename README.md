# ProjectKoraBlocks Website
This is a proof of concept website implementation using Google's Blockly. It allows a client to use block coding to build an ability - in concept.

There is no way to export abilities. Even if this website gets complete, it would only be one half of what is needed for an ability creator. A java parser for ProjectKorra is still required - which hasn't been developed.

# Development
Custom blocks are created using [this website](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html). You can import the `library.xml` file to continue my progress. Custom blocks can then be developed, before being exported back into `customblocks.js`
